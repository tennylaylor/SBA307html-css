        <h1>Why The TV Stinks.</h1>

        <section class="intro-text">
            <h2>TV Series</h2>
            <p>The Fandom isn't upset by another turning of the wheel adaptation. They're upset by poor plot, unrealistic character development, and overall low quality writing. 
                This further confirmed by Sanderson and others on plot points and magic systems being badly made.I want to get this out of the way first. An adaptation doesn't need to be 1-1 to be a good adaptation. I wasn't expecting it to be. I just expected a basic level of competency. People said before the show came out that the makers were fans of the series. Maybe they are fans of the lore and the aesthetic but definitely not of the characters or societies they live in. The show is only the Wheel of Time on the most basic level. Opening rant over; time for details.

                Societies:
                
                Emond's Field:
                
                In the book, time is taken to hammer out the dynamics of the town with particular attention given to the Women's Circle. We know how every person fits in. In the show we aren't shown anything of substance. The town lacks character and is made to feel like just a small farming village.
                
                Road to Caemlyn:
                
                This section is almost entirely cut which is extremely detrimental to our main character. This is where they are slowly revealed to be of importance and ends with an encounter in Caemlyn solidifying that fact. Caemlyn itself is also completely skipped as of episode 5. There's also several important characters that are removed by this choice.
                
                Tar Valon:
                
                Not much to say on here. Likely to get more development in the coming episodes.
                
                The Characters:
                
                Matrim Cauthon-
                
                Mat is turned into a thief with shitty parents. This completely undermines his character as he is meant to be a fundamentaly good person who pretends to be selfish but is always willing to stick his neck out for his friends.
                
                Egwene-
                
                She is not fucking Taveren. The show insinuating that she is completely destroys what makes her great. She is the only character in the books who gets where she is through merit. Other than that, I am mostly ok with her character. Her and Rand having sex is a complete butchering of her and Rands' morals (which are strongly present in the books) but it was a bit expected.
                
                Perrin-
                
                Perrin was not married in Emond's Field. They give him wife and then kill her off for drama . Show Perrin is also not very interested in blacksmithing which is rough for his character especially with him having to choose between the hammer and the axe eventually. The actor is the only one I don't really buy. The medium change has been rough on Perrin since he is a quiet, reserved character and without access to his thoughts in book form he comes off as bland. The actor needs to emote with Perrin more to sell it since we can't read his thoughts.
                
                Nynaeve-
                
                Mostly good actually. She is more mild-mannered which may bother some. The actress has performed very well which lessened my criticism some. Easily the most book accurate if we think of late books Nynaeve.
                
                Rand al' Thor-
                
                hours of incoherent screaming I could make an entire rant on how botched his character is. They intentionally leave out many defining character moments for Rand to ferment a sense of mystery but it completely ruins what may be the best written character in fiction. This is fine.</p>
            <H2>The Book series</H2>
            <p>In my opinion, books 1-7 are some of the greatest fantasy books ever written. Books 8-10, the pace does indeed slow down, but a good portion of the hate against them comes from those of us who were reading them as they came out. It was really frustrating being super excited for the next book, finding out that things moved much less than you expected, and you had to wait years for more. There was also a bit of a shift in plot structure. Books 1-6/7 each had their own plot arc, with a definite beginning, middle, and end.
                 Around book 7,It is basically a master class in world building. It is a fully realized planet with distinct cultures and a deep rich history, rivalries, alliances, prejudices. The characters are distinct and fully realized, there is a clear evolution in all of them throughout. The world is internally very consistent, a near impossible task given the scope. The tactics described in both personal combat and in larged pitched battles are phenomenally well done. The system of magic is unique, much unlike anything done previously in fantasy.</p>

                <h3>My Thoughts on the show </h3>
                <p>I'm a huge fan of the book series. I was confused at the visual choices made
                    disapponted by the character motivations. I spent questioning the directors mental
                    stability to preform his job.</p>
